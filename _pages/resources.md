##### RNN & LSTM: 
- [CS231n Recurrent Neural Networks notes](https://cs231n.github.io/rnn/)
- [Introduction to recurrent neural networks by Jeremy Jordan](https://www.jeremyjordan.me/introduction-to-recurrent-neural-networks/)
- [Understanding LSTM Networks by Christopher Olah](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/)

##### CNN:
- [MIT: Machine Learning 6.036, Lecture 8: Convolutional neural networks (Fall 2020) by Tamara Brodrick](https://youtu.be/sFEZ180RvTI?si=8l8xGxYtC7S0IiEF)

##### Papers: 
For me, a good paper is one that is easy to read and understand, while also imparting knowledge or answering a question.

- [Evaluating CLIP: Towards Characterization of Broader Capabilities and Downstream Implications](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2108.02818)
